in react we use components(reusalble components) instead of DOM
; components helps us write reusable, modular, and better organixed code

assencially  a react application is tree of components 

1. setting up the development Environment
* must have node version >=16

2. creating a react app (two way)
* create react app( CRA)
* Vite (npm create vite@latest or npm create vite@4.1.0)
--> ask name of project -> react-app
--> ask select a framework -> vanilla (pure js without and third party tool) or vue or react --> select react
--> now have to select language, js or typescript
* now it will tell you 
Done. Now run:

  cd react-app
  npm install or npm i ( install all the third party dependency)
  npm run dev

  note: if you want to open this project direct in the vs code and use (code .)

  3. project structure
  * node_modules-> (all the third party modules are installed)
  * public -> where all the imgs, videos should be there
  * src -> we have a default component called single app component -> App.tsx
  * outside we have --> index.html -> we have div with id (root) that is the container for our application
  and below it we have a script src= '/src/main.tsx' -> which is entry point of our application 

  4. creatign a React component
  use ts --> for typescript file 
  and tsx --> for typescript react component
  --> so first make a typescript component called -> Message.tsx

  * there is two way to create react component 1. js class 2. fn , these day fn base component become more popular bz these are more consize and easy to write
--> eg funcation Message() {}

note: '.' period mean current folder

5. how react work 
6. React Ecosystem
* we have learnt about that react is a js lib for buildig user interfaces
but we also have some framework like Angular and Vue so what is diff bw lib and framework
--> lib -> A tool that provides specific functionality
--> framework -> A set of tools and guidelines for building apps
* so react is only a tool which is made to inhence the UI (dynamic and interactive user interfaces)
that why we hardly use only react to build modern application we often need addition tools like 1. 'Routing' (allowing to the user to go from one page to another ) 
2. HTTP (make HTTP calls), 3. Managing app state, 3. internationalization ,4. form validation, 5. Animations --> so react don't demant any specific tool you can use any others 


6. Building components; we will learnt
* Building components 
* Rendering markup with JSX
* Managing state
* Managing state
* Passing input via props
* Debugging React apps
